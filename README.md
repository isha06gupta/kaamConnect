# 📱 KaamConnect – Empowering India's Informal Workforce

**KaamConnect** is a multilingual, voice-assisted, job-matching platform designed to connect migrant and informal workers
with fair, skill-based employment opportunities in urban areas. The platform focuses on accessibility, trust, and inclusivity for workers with low digital literacy.

---

## ✅ Project Statement

Millions of migrant workers in cities like Delhi have valuable skills but are stuck in low-paying, unstable jobs due to lack 
of access, digital literacy, and trust in existing platforms. KaamConnect bridges this gap through a simple, phone-based interface connecting workers to fair, verified jobs.
